## What is Laravel

Laravel is a PHP framework. It provides many useful tools to help you build web applications quickly and easily.

The word "Laravel" does not exist in English. How did this name come about? It is said that the creator of Laravel, Taylor Otwell, was inspired by Cair Paravel, the castle in the novel "The Chronicles of Narnia," and decided to name his framework Laravel.

## Installation

Before creating your first Laravel project, make sure that your local machine has PHP and Composer installed.

### PHP

Check if PHP is already installed

php -vIf PHP is not installed, please follow the previous article to install PHP.

### Composer

Composer is a package manager for PHP. It helps you install and update the dependencies of your project.

Check if Composer is already installed

It's a bit different here, Composer's -V is an uppercase V.

composer -VAnd you will see：

Composer version 2.7.2 2024-03-11 17:12:18
PHP version 8.3.3 (/opt/homebrew/Cellar/php/8.3.3_1/bin/php)If Composere is not installed, you will see:

command not found: composerIf that's the case, let's install it.

Open the page: https://getcomposer.org/download/

Run these commands:

php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
php -r "if (hash_file('sha384', 'composer-setup.php') === 'dac665fdc30fdd8ec78b38b9800061b4150413ff2e3b6f88543c636f7cd84f6db9189d43a81e5503cda447da73c7e5b6') { echo 'Installer verified'; } else { echo 'Installer corrupt'; unlink('composer-setup.php'); } echo PHP_EOL;"
php composer-setup.php
php -r "unlink('composer-setup.php');"And

sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composerThat’s all!
